## Week 1 Assignment

Now that you've learned some HTML, it's time to put it to pratice.  Over the course of the next few assignments you will start to put together a basic website.  In the last class you will have a chance to demo your websites to each other!

### Part 1: Writing your own HTML web pages

Think of a website you would like to start building, and begin laying out the foundation for that website in HTML.  Try using as many tags as possible.  Your website should have multiple pages with links to move between them.  You should also have one or more links to a particular part of a webpage (link to a tag by its `id`).

### Part 2: Playing with other websites

Go spend some time on other websites using `Inspect Element` and modifying the HTML for those web pages.  See how many changes you can make - try replacing logos with your name, adding text, etc.  Have fun with this, and show off your awesome skillz to your friends!

### Part 3: Learning more HTML

Next week we are going to move on to CSS, the language used for styling websites.  Now that you know the basics of HTML, you should be able to discover new tags on your own and see what you can do with them.  The fundamentals of the language are all the same.  Take some time to discover new HTML tags and features, and add them to your webpage.  In particular, look up the `table` and `iframe` tags and try using them.  Alternatively, see if you can figure out how to embed a YouTube video in your webpage.

This completes the assignment.  If you would like your homework reviewed, please zip the folder with your HTML files and send it to daniel.dickstein@yale.edu.  Also feel free to email with any questions, comments, or concerns.
