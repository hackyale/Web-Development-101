## Week 3 Assignment

This is the second CSS assignment.  The goal of this assignment is to make sure you feel comfortable styling your website.  By now you should be able to make your website look exactly how you want.  All that remains is learning more CSS properties and values, and if you'd like, some more advanced selectors.

### Part 1: Positioning elements on your website

Try using various types of positioning and sizing techniques to achieve the precise layout you want.  Here are some further positioning topics to explore:

1. CSS Float Theory
2. What happens when you specify negative padding or margins?

### Part 2: Learning more CSS

Try styling your website exactly how you imagine it, until you find yourself unsure how to do something in CSS.  Then go research the property / value you need.  Some examples:

1. How to use an image as a background
2. How to make an element invisible (take a look at the visibility and display properties)
3. How to style nested lists in outline form (outer level is roman numerals, then capital letters, then numbers...)
4. How to select elements based on attribute values

### Part 3: Finish your website

At this point you should be able to finish your website's appearance.  Your website is now a **static website**; it doesn't "do" anything other than display information that never changes unless the underlying code is edited.  Still, many of the websites on the internet are of this variety, so congratulate yourself on coming this far.  Continue exploring HTML and CSS, adding pages to your website, and try to polish your website so it's presentable.

This completes the assignment.  If you would like me to give you feedback on your website, please zip the folder with your HTML files and send it to daniel.dickstein@yale.edu.  Also feel free to email with any questions, comments, or concerns.  In our next class we are going to take some time for you to show each other your websites so you can share ideas and any new HTML or CSS discoveries.
