## Week 2 Assignment

This is the first CSS assignment.  The goal of this assignment is to make your website a _little_ bit cleaner.  The assignment's parameters are rather loose - in general, try to build out your website and make it as clean and pretty as you can.

### Part 1: Adding CSS to your website

Style the tags on your website from last week's homework using the CSS rules we discussed in class. You can use the same style sheet for both html pages or you can use different sheets for different pages.  Next class we will talk about how to be more specific with your CSS rules so it will be easier to use the same CSS file for multiple HTML documents and still have certain rules that only apply to one HTML document.  You can also have a "master CSS file" that all the pages include, and then page-specific CSS files in addition.  How you choose to organize your CSS files is up to you.

### Part 2: Playing with other websites

Go spend some time on other websites using `Inspect Element` and modifying the CSS for those web pages.  The ability to replace CSS on webpages makes `Inspect Element` even more powerful.  Try changing styles like fonts and sizes to make websites more readable.  You can also change background colors on video websites from white to grey so that they are less bright when watching shows.  Play with the CSS for several web pages and do something creative to show your friends.

### Part 3: Learning more CSS

We are going to spend more time on CSS, but that shouldn't stop you from learning more on your own.  Try learning some more properties that you can start using (you can Google for commonly used CSS properties and see if you can get them to work).

### Part 4: Practice Binary and Hexadecimal Conversions

Converting numbers between decimal (base 10), binary (base 2), and hexadecimal (base 16) can be confusing at first.  Try the examples below to make sure you get the hang of it.  There are online converters you can use to double check your answer and make sure you're right.

Sometimes it's not obvious what base a number is using.  For example, the number 10 is valid binary, decimal, and hexadecimal.  We usually note the base of the number using a prefix:

10 = "10 in base 10"  
0b10 = "10 in base 2"  
0x10 = "10 in base 16"

Exercises:

1. What is 523 in binary?
2. What is 0xF2 in decimal?
3. What is 0b10011101 in hexadecimal?

Another common base is octal (base 8). The digits range from 0-7, and columns are powers of 8. The prefix for octal is usually just a 0.

4. What is 031 in decimal?

Bonus: Can you figure out why programmers confuse Halloween and Christmas?

### Part 5: Expand your website

The more HTML you have on your website the more interesting things you'll be able to do with CSS.  Add a few more pages to your website, and try to also learn one or two new HTML tags to use in those pages.

This completes the assignment.  If you would like your homework reviewed, please zip the folder with your HTML files and send it to daniel.dickstein@yale.edu.  Also feel free to email with any questions, comments, or concerns.
